DWCU & DOGEUSD Smart Contract Project Overview
🚀 Project Overview
This project consists of two core smart contracts: the DOGEUSD Price Oracle​ and the DWCU Token Contract, together building a comprehensive ecosystem that integrates Real World Assets (RWA), Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and governance functionalities.
📊 DOGEUSD Price Oracle
Core Features
Multi-Source Data Aggregation: Integrates multiple mainstream exchanges and price data sources
Real-Time Price Updates: Obtains accurate market prices through Chainlink oracles
Intelligent Data Validation: Automatically detects and handles expired or abnormal price data
Decentralized Governance: Role-based permission management system
Technical Features
✅ Supports up to 10 different data sources
✅ Weighted average price algorithm ensures accuracy
✅ Price freshness detection and alerting mechanism
✅ Emergency pause and risk control functions
✅ Complete access control and audit logging
Application Scenarios
Price feeding for DeFi protocols
Decentralized exchange trading pair pricing
Collateral valuation for lending protocols
Underlying asset pricing for derivatives trading
💰 DWCU Token Contract
Core Features
Wrapped Asset Token: Digitally wrapped unit representing Dogecoin value
Complete ERC20 Standard: Fully compatible with existing DeFi ecosystem
Governance & Voting: Built-in decentralized governance mechanism
Staking Reward System: Holders can earn passive income
Deflationary Mechanism: Partial burn of transfer fees promotes value growth
Technical Highlights
🔥 Dual Version Design: Complete version + simplified version for different needs
🔥 Multi-Role Permissions: Fine-grained permission control including MINTER, PAUSER, STAKING_MANAGER
🔥 Dynamic Fee Structure: Adjustable transfer fees and burn ratios
🔥 Security Mechanisms: Reentrancy protection, emergency pause, limit controls
🔥 Gas Optimization: ERC20Permit support for gasless approvals
Economic Model
Total Supply: 210 million tokens (initial minting of 21 million)
Distribution Mechanism: Gradual release to avoid inflation shock
Incentive Mechanism: Staking annual yield up to 10%
Deflationary Mechanism: 20% of transfer fees permanently burned
